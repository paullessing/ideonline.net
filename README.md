This project is intended to provide a browser-based JS evaluation environment to allow on-the-go running of simple scripts.

## Initial work
At the start, this will be a JS-only project, aiming for good usability on mobile devices and best conformity with [PWA requirements](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).

## Further work
Aim is to get multiple scripts stored per user, and TypeScript compilation client-side in a service worker environment.
